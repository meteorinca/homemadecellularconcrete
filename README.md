## Lightweight cellular foamed concrete

### **The Goal:**
Create a lightweight, cellular foamed concrete (similar to AAC or aircrete) using common materials. The foam, generated from laundry detergent, traps air bubbles in the cement mix, drastically reducing weight while maintaining a solid structure.

### **Phase 1: Preparation & Setup**

**Step 1: Gather Materials & Tools**
*   **Materials:**
    *   Cement (7 kg / ~15.4 lbs)
    *   Clean Water (5 L / ~1.3 gal + extra for foam)
    *   Powdered Laundry Detergent (50 g / ~1.8 oz)
    *   Construction Plaster (Gypsum) (1 kg / ~2.2 lbs)
    *   Chopped Fiberglass Strands (50 g / ~1.8 oz)
    *   Plasticizing Aditive (50 ml / ~1.7 oz) - improves workability.
    *   Release Agent (Used motor oil, vegetable oil, or commercial release agent).
*   **Tools & Equipment:**
    *   Drill with a paint mixer attachment.
    *   Steel Wool & Cable Ties (for modifying the mixer).
    *   Large mixing basin (40 L / ~10 gal capacity).
    *   Bucket for making foam (30 L / ~8 gal).
    *   Wooden Mold (e.g., 50x20x10 cm).
    *   Gloves, safety glasses, and a dust mask.

**Step 2: Modify the Mixer (The "Foam Generator")**
*   Wrap steel wool tightly around the spiral of the paint mixer.
*   Secure it firmly with nylon cable ties.
*   **Why?** This increases surface area and friction, which violently agitates the water and detergent solution. This intense agitation is crucial for creating a dense, stable foam filled with tiny, strong air bubbles (microfoam), rather than just suds.

**Step 3: Prepare the Molds**
*   Assemble your wooden mold.
*   Apply a thin, even coat of your release agent (e.g., used motor oil) to all interior surfaces.
*   **Why?** This prevents the cured concrete from bonding to the wood, allowing for clean demolding without damaging your piece.

### **Phase 2: Mixing Process**

**Step 4: Start the Base Cement Mixture**
*   In your large basin, pour 5 liters of clean water.
*   Add the 50 ml of plasticizing additive to the water and mix briefly.
*   While continuously mixing (using a mortar mixer or your modified drill on a slow setting), gradually add all 7 kg of cement.
*   Mix until you achieve a smooth, lump-free, homogeneous cement paste.

**Step 5: Add Reinforcement**
*   To the base cement mixture, add the 50 g of chopped fiberglass strands.
*   Mix thoroughly to distribute the strands evenly.
*   **Why?** Fiberglass acts as micro-reinforcement. It helps hold the material together, controls shrinkage, and prevents the formation and spread of micro-cracks, giving the brittle foam structure better tensile strength.

**Step 6: Generate the Detergent Foam**
*   In your separate 30 L bucket, add about 2 liters of water.
*   Add the 50 g of powdered laundry detergent.
*   Using your **modified drill mixer on high speed**, agitate the solution vigorously for several minutes.
*   **The Science:** Detergent contains surfactants. Intense mechanical agitation forces these surfactant molecules to align and trap vast amounts of air, creating a high-volume, dense foam with stable bubble walls. You should end up with a bucket full of stiff, shaving cream-like foam (approx. 30 L volume).

**Step 7: Combine Foam with Cement (The Critical Step)**
*   **Work quickly from this point.**
*   Pour the entire volume of generated foam into the basin with your fiberglass-cement paste.
*   **Mix rapidly but carefully.** Your goal is to fully incorporate the foam *without* collapsing all the bubbles. Fold and stir until the mixture is uniform in color and texture. It will resemble a very thick, airy mousse or cake batter. This is now **cellular concrete**.

**Step 8: Add the Plaster (Accelerator)**
*   Immediately add the 1 kg of construction plaster (gypsum) to the foamed mixture.
*   Mix **extremely quickly and thoroughly**.
*   **Why?** Plaster (calcium sulfate) accelerates the setting reaction of the cement. It provides early strength and rigidity, which is essential to "lock" the air bubble structure in place before the foam can collapse. You now have only a few minutes to work.

### **Phase 3: Molding & Curing**

**Step 9: Pour into Molds**
*   Immediately pour or scoop your foamed concrete mixture into the prepared mold.
*   Tap or vibrate the mold gently to help it settle and remove large air pockets.
*   **Do not overwork it.** Simply level the top as best you can.
*   The mixture will hold its shape and will not flow like traditional concrete.

**Step 10: Initial Cure**
*   Let the mold sit undisturbed for **24-48 hours**.
*   The plaster will cause it to set firmly enough for demolding within this time.
*   **For full strength:** True concrete strength develops over 28 days. Keep the demolded piece in a moist, controlled environment for this period for maximum performance.

### **Phase 4: Results & Testing (After 48 Hours)**

**Test 1: Weight Reduction**
*   Compare the weight of your foamed concrete brick to a solid concrete brick of the same dimensions.
*   **Expected Result:** A **~60% reduction in weight**. This is the primary benefit—dramatically lighter material.

**Test 2: Buoyancy**
*   Place a cured piece (like a small block or pot) in a basin of water.
*   **Expected Result:** It will **float**. Traditional concrete sinks. The high volume of trapped air makes the material less dense than water.

**Test 3: Workability / Cutability**
*   Use a handsaw to cut a cured brick.
*   **Expected Result:** You can **saw through it relatively easily** without damaging the saw's teeth significantly. It cuts like a very hard wood or rigid foam, demonstrating its low density and machinability.

### **Summary: The "Why" Behind Each Component**

| Component | Role in the Process |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cement** | The binder. Forms the solid matrix that hardens around the air bubbles. |
| **Laundry Detergent** | The **foaming agent**. Its surfactants create stable air bubbles when agitated, forming the "cellular" structure. |
| **Modified Mixer** | The **foam generator**. High-shear agitation is mandatory to create the necessary microfoam. |
| **Fiberglass** | The **reinforcement**. Provides internal strength and crack resistance to the fragile foam walls. |
| **Plaster (Gypsum)** | The **accelerator**. Speeds up setting time dramatically, freezing the foam structure in place. |
| **Plasticizer** | The **lubricant**. Makes the initial cement paste more workable with less water, improving final strength. |

**Final Note:** This is a **homemade, experimental adaptation** of industrial foamed concrete processes. While it demonstrates the core scientific principles (entraining air with surfactants to reduce density), achieving consistent, structurally reliable results for load-bearing applications requires precise industrial equipment and quality control. It's excellent for crafts, models, non-structural garden items, and learning the science of lightweight concrete.
